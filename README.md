## About the program
A network vulnerability scanner for my computer science AQA A-level NEA. This project is no longer supported.

## How to use (Windows only)
Install all requirements from requirements.txt using pip or an IDE's library-manager and run main.py from src with all the other files from src present in the same directory.

## Remaining issues
- No Linux support
- The user is never informed of any error handling the program does, and there is no error handling implementation for when `nmap-service-probes.txt` is corrupt or missing.

## Legal notice
Please check notice.txt
